# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Game


Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock is a variant of Rock-paper-scissors that allows five choices. Each choice wins against two other choices, loses against two other choices and ties against itself. Much of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock's popularity is that it has been featured in 3 episodes of the TV series "The Big Bang Theory".
